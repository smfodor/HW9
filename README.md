# HW9-Database
In this homework you will read tweet information about "umsi" and from the user "umsi" from a cache file (or from Twitter if the cache isn't present) and then store it in a sqlite database. You will also write several functions to return information from the database. 

- See HW-DB.py for more details.
- See twitter_cache.json for the cache data that you will use for running the unittests.

  

Clone the project to your local computer 
  - git clone projecturl
- Edit HW-DB.py to add code and test with the unittests
- Add the modified file to your list of files to commit and check the status
  - git add HW-DB.py
  - git status  
- Be sure to do commits several times over the project. Do a commit each time that you get something working. You need to do at least 3 commits at least 4 hours apart to get the full credit for git commits unless you submit at least 24 hours before the deadline then the commits don't have to be 4 hours apart. 
  - git commit -m "Explanation of what you have added"
- Do a push to put your changes on your fork of this repo on github.  You don't have to do a pull request.  
  - git push -u origin master
- Upload a link to your repository on canvas to submit.
